# Refugee Lib

(*early WIP (v.-1.0) / September 17th 2014 *)
*this is a very early, very incomplete version of the documentation and it will be extended within the next couple of days*

## Introduction

The goal of **Refugee Lib** is to provide an easy-to-use HTML5/javascript library for writing games and applications which primarily run directly inside a website without the need to download and install any extensions.

**Refugee Lib** provides (*will provide*) functions to handle common tasks like loading assets, running and maintaining a steady game main-loop, pre-processing input from different devices and calling user-defined callbacks when it is time to update game-state and view.

(The long-term plan after that is to maybe extend the library at some point in the future with optional modules to make use of features which are only available to installable Chrome apps, such as direct access to UDP/TCP sockets and the local filesystem and other native-client and portable-native-client code.)
