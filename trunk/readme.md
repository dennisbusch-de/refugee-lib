# Refugee Lib
[version](./rlCore.html#version) - 
(*this documentation is a work in progress and subject to be changed/extended as the library development progresses*)
  
## Introduction
The goal of **Refugee Lib** is to provide an easy-to-use HTML5/javascript library for writing games and applications which primarily run directly inside a website without the need to download and install any extensions.

**Refugee Lib** provides functions to handle common tasks like loading assets, running and maintaining a steady game main-loop, pre-processing input from different devices and calling user-defined callbacks when it is time to update game-state and view.

(It also provides (*will provide*) functions to handle a broad range of other things commonly useful in game development, like managing animations, testing for collisions, playing sounds, string localization, lightweight GUI building, displaying graphics and whatever else I think will be interesting to implement and useful to have.)

((A potential future expansion would be to add optional modules to utilize features which are only available to installable Chrome apps, such as direct access to UDP/TCP sockets and the local filesystem and other native-client and portable-native-client code.))
